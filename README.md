# Stock-analysis
Comparing stocks between 2017 and 2018
### Overview of Project
 
  Refactor code in VBA to compare stocks from 2017 and 2018
#### Purpose
  
  To learn how to adjust the code to decrease the run time of Macros within Excel. 

##### Results
I had an Issue in my code that I could not figure out. It produced the same data for 2017 as well as 2018 so I could not compare 
how the stocks did between the 2 years. 

###### Summary
The project was to take existing code and refacor it to make it run more economically saving time while still comparing the data correctly.
While everything seemed to be accurate with the adjustments in the code it still produced the same results for 2017 and 2018 so I was unable to verify the
stock performance between the 2 years.
