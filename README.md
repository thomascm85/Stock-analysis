##### Results
Stocks Overall did better in 2017 than in 2018 with the exception of RUN which outperformed how it did in 2017 by a large margin. In 2018 most of the stocks were negative while in 2017 they all were positive except for TERP.

The refeactoring allowed the macro to run in 1.39 seconds and verified that the results matched those in the lesson. The stocks in 2017 did far better than those in 2018 with the exception of one stock. In 2017 all but one stock were in the positive.
